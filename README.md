# Data Structures

This is a library of data structures implemented in JavaScript, using CommonJS modules and NodeJS 18.14 as the interpreter.

The library is based mainly on David Mount's lecture notes, as well as the book 'Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms' by Loiane Groner.

Note: This library is currently under construction and is not yet ready for production use.
