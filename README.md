# Data Structures

This is a JavaScript library of commonly used data structures implemented using CommonJS modules and NodeJS 18.14 as the interpreter.
The library also includes a set of unit tests written using the Jasmine testing framework.

The library is based on David Mount's lecture notes and other authoritative sources such as the book 'Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms'
by Loiane Groner and 'Introduction to Algorithms' by Thomas Cormen.

This library is currently in development and should not be used in production environments.

## How to Run

npm install
node ./\*.test.js
